# README

This is a project about deep reinforcement learning autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithm for **UAV**. The whole project includes obstacle avoidance in **static environment** and obstacle avoidance in **dynamic environment**. In the static environment, **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** and **artificial potential field algorithm** are combined. In the dynamic environment, the project adopts the combination of **disturbed flow field algorithm** and **single agent reinforcement learning algorithm**.

As this is my undergraduate graduation project and my academic level is limited, I wrote a conference paper at that time. The address of the paper is: [Adaptive Interfered Fluid Dynamic System Algorithm Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-9492-9_139)

## Static environment

There are four methods to solve:

1. **MADDPG**
2. **Fully Centralized DDPG**
3. **Fully Decentralized DDPG**
4. **Fully Centralized TD3**

The third and the fourth methods perform better than others.

## Dynamic environment

There are four methods to solve:

1. **PPO+GAE(with multi-processing )**
2. **TD3**
3. **DDPG**
4. **SAC**

The first three methods perform just the same. PPO convergence needs less episodes. TD3 and DDPG converge fast. Though Soft Actor-Critic is an outstanding algorithm in DRL, it has no obvious effect in my environment.

## Traditional methods for  UAV path planning

Three traditional methods are written with **MATLAB**:

1. **A * search algorithm***
2. **RRT algorithm**
3. **Ant colony algorithm**

**C++:**

1. **D star algorithm**

The experiments show that A* search algorithm is much better than others but it is less effective than reinforcement learning path planning.

## Artificial potential field algorithm

This project provides the MATLAB and Python realization of artificial potential field algorithm.

**Python realization**: ./APF/APFPy2.py      ./APF/APFPy3.py    ./APF/ApfAlgorithm.py  (two-dimensional and three-dimensional)

**Matlab realization**: ./APF/APF_matlab (two-dimensional)

## IFDS and IIFDS algorithm

This is an obstacle avoidance planning algorithm based on flow field. I realize it with matlab. The code is in folder **IIFDS_and_IFDS**.

## How to begin trainning

For example, you want to train the agent in dynamic environment with TD3, what you need to do is just running the **main.py**, then **test.py**, finally open matlab and run the **test.m** to draw.

If you want to test the model in the environment with 4 obstacles, you just need to run  **Multi_obstacle_environment_test.py**.

## Requirements

numpy

torch

matplotlib

seaborn==0.11.1
